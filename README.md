# Driver Monitoring System

## 📌 Introduction
The **Driver Monitoring System** is a **web-based platform** designed to track and evaluate drivers' behavior and performance.  
It helps logistics companies improve **safety**, monitor trips, and reduce risks through **real-time monitoring** and **analytics**.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API  
- **Frontend:** Blazor  
- **Database:** SQL Server  
- **AI Integration:** OpenAI API for driver behavior analysis  
- **Map Integration:** Google Maps API for displaying driver locations  
- **QR/Barcode Scanner:** Quickly read driver or shipment data  

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Monitor drivers and view their locations on a **real-time map**  
- Receive instant notifications for lateness or violations (**Notifications**)  
- Read **QR Codes / Barcodes** to quickly update data  
- Analyze driver behavior and classify as **Safe** or **Risky** using **OpenAI API**  
- Interactive and user-friendly interface (**UI**)  

---

## 💻 How to Run
1. Open the project in **Visual Studio**.  
2. Make sure **SQL Server** is set up and the database is created.  
3. Run the **Backend API** first.  
4. Run the **Blazor Frontend** next.  
5. Use the interface to log in, view driver locations on the map, and test other features.

## 📝 Notes
- Add your **API Keys** (Google Maps and OpenAI) in `appsettings.json`.  
- Ensure the database exists, or use the provided **SQL scripts** to create it.  
- `bin/` and `obj/` folders are excluded from GitHub via `.gitignore`.
